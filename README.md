# CSV data analysis using Python

This work contains two tasks. They are as follows.

PyBank: 

In this task, a Python script is written to analyse a list of financial records. They include: computation of the total time across the records, 
the net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, the average of those changes,
the greatest increase and decrease in profits and the corresponding date and amount over the entire period.
A csv file of the records is provided in a resources directory.

A python script is written that accesses the csv file to perform analyses. The script contains two functions: main.py and my_functions.py. List 
comprehensions are used to compute the Financial Analysis results. The results are printed to a seperate file and saved to a different directory. The
results are also printed on console.

PyPoll:

In this task, a Python script is written to determine the election results recorded in a csv file. The solution contains two functions named also as 
main.py and my_functions.py. An algorithm is developed that goes through the voting records to obtain the candidates names and the total votes each of 
them received. Python built-in functions such as list, zip, list comprehensions, ittemgetter (from module operator) are used to generate the results 
and save them in a dictionary. A print function then prints these information on a seperate file and also to the console.
